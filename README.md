# React Design Patterns in a Banking App

A showcase of real-world usage of essential React design patterns, applied in the context of a banking dashboard. This guide helps you learn not just the patterns, but exactly where and why they matter in production systems.

## 🔍 Design Patterns and Use Cases

### 1. Container and Presentation

**Use Case:** Transaction history list

- `TransactionContainer.tsx`: Fetches and manages state
- `TransactionList.tsx`: Displays the list
- **Why:** Keeps logic and UI separate, easier to maintain

👉 *Real-World Example:* Back office team updates filters without touching UI rendering code.

---

### 2. Custom Hook Composition

**Use Case:** Fetch customer profile data

- `useCustomerData.ts`: Fetches and caches user data
- `CustomerProfile.tsx`: Displays user info
- **Why:** Reusable logic across multiple components

👉 *Real-World Example:* Used in both the dashboard and customer support panel.

---

### 3. Reducer Pattern

**Use Case:** Complex loan form with steps

- `LoanForm.tsx`: Uses `useReducer` for field management and validation
- **Why:** Centralized and predictable form state

👉 *Real-World Example:* Loan officers need full control over validation states and transitions.

---

### 4. Provider Pattern

**Use Case:** User authentication and role management

- `UserProvider.tsx`: Context for user session
- `Dashboard.tsx`: Shows sections based on user role
- **Why:** Clean global state management without prop drilling

👉 *Real-World Example:* Displaying different dashboards for admin, agent, and customer.

---

### 5. Higher-Order Component (HOC)

**Use Case:** Add access control to admin-only views

- `withAdminGuard.tsx`: Wraps any component
- `AdminPanel.tsx`: Secured behind HOC
- **Why:** DRY approach to reuse logic

👉 *Real-World Example:* Hide certain tabs unless the user is a branch manager.

---

### 6. Compound Components

**Use Case:** Customer support chat widget

- `Chat`: Main component
- `Chat.Header`, `Chat.Body`, `Chat.Input`
- **Why:** Flexible yet tightly coupled composition

👉 *Real-World Example:* Let support team adjust UI but maintain structure.

---

### 7. Props Combination Pattern

**Use Case:** Transaction filter settings

- `TransactionFilter.tsx`: Accepts combined props (status, type, date)
- **Why:** Flexible API for developers using your component

👉 *Real-World Example:* Advanced filters for operations team.

---

### 8. Controlled Component

**Use Case:** Transfer amount input with limits

- `TransferForm.tsx`: Controls `amount`, validates against balance
- **Why:** Full control over validation and state

👉 *Real-World Example:* Block user if they exceed daily limit.

---

### 9. Error Boundary

**Use Case:** Prevent crash from broken widgets

- `ErrorBoundary.tsx`: Wraps risky components (e.g., charts)
- **Why:** Show fallback UI instead of breaking entire page

👉 *Real-World Example:* Graph API fails, show “data unavailable” instead of white screen.

---

### 10. Forward Ref

**Use Case:** Focus input on page load (e.g., OTP input)

- `OtpInput.tsx`: Exposes ref to focus from parent
- **Why:** Imperative interaction support

👉 *Real-World Example:* Automatically focus on first OTP field after login.

---

### 11. Lazy Loading

**Use Case:** Load loan calculator only when user opens tab

- `LoanCalculator.tsx`: Lazy loaded in `App.tsx`
- **Why:** Reduce initial bundle size

👉 *Real-World Example:* Improve app speed by splitting features.

---

### 12. Memoization

**Use Case:** Customer segmentation analytics

- `SegmentList.tsx`: Memoized render to avoid recomputation
- **Why:** Optimize performance

👉 *Real-World Example:* Avoid rerendering large tables when unrelated state changes.

## 📚 Why It Matters

In large-scale apps like **banking dashboards**, applying the right pattern:

- Improves **maintainability**
- Ensures **performance**
- Enables **scalability**
- Enhances **developer collaboration**

Use this repo as a reference, learning tool, or a starting point for your own app architecture.
